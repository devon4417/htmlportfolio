<h3>OnePiece</h3>
<p>
  This one is by my favorite!, The show started a long time ago and still
  continues to this day at more than 1200 episodes. Its the lonest running show
  that i have ever hear, and the characters and universe has aged appropriatly
  too. <a href="Https://www.crunchyroll.com">Click here</a> to Watch it on

<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>
  This show is that any anime fan would say is "one of the best". I would agree
  on that, but its ending left me with wanting more, and there hasnt been any
  more for over a decade now. This anime, unfortunatly will no longer continue
  its amazing story about killing the evil deamons that are preying on the souls
  of good people. Visit their

<h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
<p>
  Im sure a mojoirty of amine enthusiasts would be wondering, " What about
  DBZ?!". well, its just to predicatable at this point. Yeah, its a show thats
  been going for a long time, and its still running. But as i said, its not up
  to the standards of This show. Hunter x Hunter is a Thrilling show of a boy
  thats trying to meet his father, a hunter. For him to do so, he needs to
  become one and get his liscense too. This requires a gruelling trial that is
  live or die for most. suring this trial, he meets many interesting people that
  will later become his foe, but also a few friends. the show is very dark in a
  way, but still, its a story of setting goals, working though life or death
  situaltions, and pulling through agianst all odds.
